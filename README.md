## Project Overview
In this project, I'm grabbing information from an API with more than 20 sandwich's recipes and list them using a Recycle View Adapter. You have to go to the details of the sandwich for the URL to the original recipe. .

## What did I Learn?
Through this project:
- Learn how to connect API to grabbing information
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly with a Recycle Vew Adapter
